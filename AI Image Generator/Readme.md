**AI Image Generator Web Application** 🌟

This web application allows users to generate unique, AI-powered images by providing descriptive prompts. It leverages OpenAI's DALL·E model to produce creative visuals. Additionally, users can upload their own images to view detailed metadata, such as file name, size, and type. The app is designed with a simple, intuitive interface and provides real-time image generation and information retrieval.

🚀 **Features**
- **AI Image Generation:** Users can input a text prompt, and the app generates an AI image based on the description.
- **Image Upload & Info Display:** Users can upload an image to retrieve and view its details, including file name, size, and type.
- **Real-time Processing:** Prompt-based image generation and image metadata retrieval are fast and efficient.

🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-End:** Python Flask
- **AI Model:** OpenAI's DALL·E via API
- **Hosting:** Flask server
- **Image Upload:** Image metadata handling for displaying details

⚙️ **How It Works**
1. **Prompt-Based Image Generation:**
- Users enter a description of the image they want to generate.
- The prompt is sent to the Python Flask server, which communicates with OpenAI's DALL·E API to generate the image.
- The generated image is then sent back and displayed in the web interface.

2. **Image Upload:**
- Users can upload an image file.
- The server processes the image to extract and display details like the file name, size, and format.

🖥️ **Installation**

✨ Future Enhancements
- Allow users to download generated images directly.
- Add advanced image generation options (e.g., style selection, resolution settings).
- Enable batch image generation for multiple prompts.
- Improve the user interface for a better experience.
